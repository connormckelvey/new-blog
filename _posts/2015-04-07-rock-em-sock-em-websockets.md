The following video features a talk I did at [University Tech Meetups](http://www.universitytechmeetups.com/) monthly Javascript Meetup. My talk covers a basic introduction to the WebSockets Javascript API as well as some bits of security and development concerns to consider when using WebSockets.

The talk is about 30 minutes long but I encourage you to also watch the talk that follows mine.
