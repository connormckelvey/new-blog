I am a terrible blogger. I will get that right out of the way and say it. I have started multiple blogs. And I have let those blogs crumble away and die slow, painful deaths. 

_But this is where it ends._

I have never had a blog on my [connormckelvey.com](http://connormckelvey.com) for fear that I wouldn't maintain it. So I am doing away with my portfolio site and completely replacing it with a blog. What better way to solve the commitment problem than to walk right up and punching it right in the pixels.

So stay tuned as I use my words instead of screenshots of shitty websites to try to show you that I know what I am talking about.
